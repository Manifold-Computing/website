#### The Keedy Lab is growing, and is always looking for talented folks who are excited about structural biology.


## Postdocs

If you're currently finishing or have recently finished your PhD, and are interested in a postdoctoral position in the lab, please [email Dr. Keedy](mailto:daniel.keedy@asrc.cuny.edu) and include your CV.  You may also apply directly to [this official posting](https://cuny.jobs/new-york-ny/research-associate-structural-biology-advanced-science-research-center/F925C5FBF50447B5998BBCE5C59387D2/job/).  


## PhD Students

If you're interested in PhD thesis research in the Keedy Lab, you must first apply to one of the following PhD programs through the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home):
  * [CUNY PhD Program in Biochemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biochemistry/Admissions)
  * [CUNY PhD Program in Chemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Chemistry/Prospective-Students)

Once you're admitted, you'll' have the opportunity to visit the Keedy Lab at the ASRC during interviews, to do a research rotation after you enroll, and to potentially join the lab if there is a good fit.  That said, feel free to [email Dr. Keedy](mailto:daniel.keedy@asrc.cuny.edu) before or during the application process to discuss research project ideas!


## Undergraduates

If you are a talented undergraduate interested in doing research in the lab, [email Dr. Keedy](mailto:daniel.keedy@asrc.cuny.edu) with your grades in relevant courses (Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology, Computer Science, etc.).  I am more likely to accept students who can make a significant time commitment in terms of hours per week in the lab and number of semesters.
