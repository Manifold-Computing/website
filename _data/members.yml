  description: 'Daniel Keedy is an Assistant Professor with the Structural Biology Initiative at the ASRC and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the City College of New York starting January 8, 2018. Prior to his appointment, he was an AP Giannini Postdoctoral Fellow in Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco working with Professor James Fraser. He earned his PhD in Biochemistry and Structural Biology & Biophysics from Duke University after receiving his BA in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology from Rhodes College. His research on protein structural flexibility, temperature-dependent X-ray crystallography, and allosteric regulation has led to over 15 publications in leading scientific journals and over 10 presentations at a variety of scientific meetings.


                **RESEARCH INTERESTS:**

                Professor Keedy develops experimental and computational methods to control proteins by biasing toward specific conformations that underlie functions such as allostery, ligand binding, and catalysis. His work reveals new opportunities to modulate the activities of therapeutic targets such as tyrosine phosphatases with small molecules and protein engineering, and also offers insights into more general evolutionary processes that led to functional diversity in the human genome.
