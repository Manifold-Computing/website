  Daniel Keedy has been an Assistant Professor with the [Structural Biology Initiative](http://structbio.asrc.cuny.edu)
  at the [CUNY Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC)](http://asrc.cuny.edu)
  and the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/Chemistry) 
  at [The City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/) 
  since January 2018. 
  He is also affiliated with the PhD Programs in 
  [Biochemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biochemistry)
  and [Chemistry](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Chemistry)
  at the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/home).
  

  Prior to his appointment, Daniel was an AP Giannini Postdoctoral Fellow in Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences 
  at the University of California, San Francisco working with [James Fraser](https://fraserlab.com). 
  He earned his PhD in Biochemistry and Structural Biology & Biophysics from Duke University 
  with [Jane and David Richardson](http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu),
  after receiving his BA in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology from Rhodes College. 
  

  As principal investigator of the Keedy Lab,
  Daniel develops experimental and computational methods to control proteins by biasing toward specific 
  conformations that underlie functions such as allostery, ligand binding, and catalysis. 
  His work reveals new opportunities to modulate the activities of therapeutic targets 
  such as protein tyrosine phosphatases with small molecules and protein engineering, 
  and also offers insights into more general evolutionary processes that led to functional diversity in the human proteome.

  Tamar graduated summa cum laude from Chatham University in Pittsburgh in 2016, 
  where she received her Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry. 
  After graduating, she worked with [Dr. David Koes](http://bits.csb.pitt.edu/) 
  at the University of Pittsburgh on computational drug design for various therapeutic targets. 
  Tamar is now pursuing her PhD in 
  [Biochemistry at CUNY](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Biochemistry).
  In 2018, she joined the Keedy Lab, 
  where she is developing computational strategies to leverage multistate models of protein structures
  with large numbers of protein:ligand structures to design novel allosteric inhibitors for phosphatases.

  After completing her undergraduate studies in India, 
  Maryam Azeem pursued her master’s degree in the US starting in 2015.  
  She joined [Dr. Kathleen Frey’s lab](https://sites.google.com/view/kfreyliupharm/home) 
  in 2016 in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at Long Island University in Brooklyn.  
  While working under Dr. Frey’s supervision, 
  Maryam developed her research interests in structural biology and X-ray crystallography.  
  She used computational and structure-based methods for creating docking models, 
  predicting mutations in the HIV Reverse Transcriptase enzyme, and analyzing protein-ligand interactions.
  In 2018, Maryam joined the Keedy Lab,
  where she is spearheading efforts to characterize the "invisible" conformations of tyrosine phosphatase enzymes
  and reveal how they contribute to allosteric regulation.

  Sakib is a recent graduate of Hunter College with a major in Chemistry and a concentration in Bioinformatics.
  He joined the Keedy Lab in 2018.
  His research in the lab uses X-ray crystallography to reveal how sequence differences rewire allosteric networks in related phosphatases.
  He has also investigated how protein structures satisfy particular hydrogen bonding interactions in multiple different ways.
  Last but not least, he is the designer of this website!

  Sergei is finishing his B.S. degree in biotechnology at City College of New York, just next-door to the ASRC.
  In fall 2019 he joined the Keedy Lab,
  where he is using several tools including liquid handling robots
  to biophysically characterize putative allosteric inhibitors for PTP1B.
  Sergei loves interacting with the scientific community here at the ASRC!
