  <p>We are part of the <a href="http://structbio.asrc.cuny.edu/">Structural Biology Initiative</a>
  of the <a href="http://asrc.cuny.edu/">CUNY Advanced Science Research Center</a> 
  in New York City.

  <p>Our research aims to better understand the "secret lives" of proteins:
  how they move when we''re not looking, 
  how their motions contribute to biology,
  and how they are regulated to control how proteins function in cells.
