  content: '                        <p>We are part of the ASRC the <a href="http://structbio.asrc.cuny.edu/">Structural Biology Initiative</a></p>
                        <p>Research in the lab is focused on discovering the fundamental principles of macromolecular structure and dynamics. We are interested in defining conformational states that are essential for function and understanding how conformational transitions couple to biological mechanisms.</p>
                        <p>We are located in the Structural Biology Initiative at the CUNY Advanced Science Research Center.<p>'
