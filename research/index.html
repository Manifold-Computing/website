<!-- In the Keedy Lab, we are interested in the "secret lives" of protein structures:
how they move when we''re not looking, 
how their motions contribute to biology,
and how they are regulated to control how proteins function in cells.

We use cutting-edge experiments in structural biology, especially X-ray crystallography, 
combined with computational analysis of three-dimensional models,
to elucidate how proteins move and how that matters for biology.

For protein molecules, structure is critical to function.
But proteins don't like to sit still!
The alternative conformations of proteins, 
which are often overlooked by traditional structural biology methods,
can provide key insights into biological processes.
We are exploring new methods in X-ray crystallography for revealing 
the **"hidden" conformational ensembles** of proteins
and incorporating them into new types of three-dimensional models.
Our goal is to develop new methods to 
characterize excursions from the average structure in proteins
and to explore the implications of those excursions for biology.

## How are allosteric proteins "wired"?

<img src="/images/slide_ptp1b_allos_netwk.jpg" alt="" height="300" align="right"/>
Proteins have the inherent capacity to transmit signals through their three-dimensional structures. 
This phenomenon, called **allostery**, allows for exquisite control of protein function 
to regulate a wide range of cellular processes. 
Although allostery is thought to be quite prevalent among proteins, 
​our understanding of how it works at the basic atomic level remains limited​.
In the Keedy Lab, we use new methods in experimental and computational structural biology 
to elucidate the role of **transitions between low-occupancy conformations** in allostery,
and test mechanistic predictions using targeted perturbations such as mutations 
and allosteric small-molecule activators or inhibitors.
Overall, we seek to understand how 
a complex hierarchy of **mechanical coupling** between different regions of a protein structure
gives rise to allosteric communications.

## Can we elucidate the design principles of modular signaling proteins?

<img src="/images/ptp_modules.png" alt="" height="250" align="right"/>
**Protein tyrosine phosphatases** play key roles in signaling pathways within human cells.
PTPs have distinct substrate specificities, cellular roles, and disease phenotypes, 
including diabetes, cancers, arthritis, and Alzheimer’s disease.
However, they all share a structurally conserved catalytic domain.
How has Nature co-opted a single protein domain to achieve such functional diversity?
We hypothesize that in different PTPs, 
**sequence differences "rewire" the shared cataytic domain**
to receive inputs from highly diverse regulatory domains.
Our work explores how how similar proteins can be regulated in diverse ways,
even when the *average structure remains static*,
by emphasizing the key role played by energetically coupled low-occupancy states.
We aim to dissect the component-based architecture of PTPs
by characterizing the conformational ensembles of a menagerie of diverse PTPs
and using computational structure-based protein design methods to explore their modularity.
