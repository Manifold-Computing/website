The Keedy Lab is interested in how atomic motions give rise to central processes in life.

The Keedy Lab studies 




We use ____ experiments to perturb proteins with temperature, ligands, and mutations,
X-ray crystallography and other structural biololgy experiments to ___,
and computational modeling to integrate ____.


We use new approaches in structural biology, 
including 


## Mapping the intramolecular "nervous systems" of proteins

Our goal is to elucidate the conformational ensembles of proteins and understand how they
are modulated by ligands, mutations, protein:protein interactions, and other perturbations to control function.

We develop new approaches in structural biology that reveal alternative conformations and how proteins transition between them could provide fresh insights into the inherent allosteric capabilities of proteins, opening new doors to unravel natural regulatory pathways, design allosteric drugs, engineer biosensors
