Congrats to Blake and Tamar for presenting their work at the [New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) Chemical Biology Symposium](https://www.nyas.org/events/2021/webinar-chemical-biology-discussion-group-year-end-symposium-2021/)!  Blake gave an excellent talk about the multiconformer modeling software [qFit 3](https://github.com/ExcitedStates/qfit-3.0), with hints toward some exciting future directions.  And Tamar gave a nice "virtual poster" about our investigations of differences in how small-molecule fragments bind to PTP1B at cryogenic vs. room temperature -- look forward to reading more about that in the not-too-distant future.
